# Test_task_for_the_position_of_front-end_developer
According to the assignment, it was necessary to do the following:

It is necessary to implement moving the object behind the cursor in JS without using jQuery.

Sequence of implementation:
- The page must contain 2 objects: input for entering text and button for applying the result

- The user enters any string in the input

- Clicks on the button and the entered line is displayed under the form

- The user clicks on any letter in the term and it moves after the cursor to any place

- User clicks again and the letter sets the last cursor position

- The user can move not only one letter, but scatter the whole word throughout the document

- If you release the moved character to the place of another character, then the second character moves to the previous place of the moved one. They don't overlap.

You cannot use any ready-made solutions, as well as libraries for moving objects. Only pure JS and css if needed.
